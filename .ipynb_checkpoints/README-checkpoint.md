# EDS220 Fall 2022 Final Project
## Combined NASA Aqua and Terra Satellites Overview -- Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI)
### Student Authors: Erika Egg, Alessandra Vidal Meza, & Elke Windschitl

## Motivation and Project Goal
The purpose of the notebook is to assess plant canopy structure in the Chihuahuan Desert and the Lacandon Jungle over time from 2017 to 2022, using the [MCD15A3H Version 6.1](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd15a3hv061/) data product produced by MODIS instruments on board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Terra and Aqua satellites. 

MCD15A3H contains data on Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). FPAR refers to the fraction of incoming solar radiation (400−700 nm) that is observed by the green entities of a plant canopy, and LAI refers to the amount of leaf material in a plant canopy that is estimated as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area in a broadleaf canopy and as the one−half of the total needle surface area per unit ground area in a coniferous canopy. 


## Intended Purpose and Important Concepts
The notebook is a learning outcome of the student authors' following skills and knowledge:
- data subsetting
- setting coordinate reference systems
- calculating rolling means
- time series plotting
